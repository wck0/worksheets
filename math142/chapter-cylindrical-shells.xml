  <title>Cylindrical Shells</title>

    <title>Shells</title>
    <p>
      We can compute volumes of solids of revolution using cylindrical shells.
      These shells are formed by following a thin rectangular region as it rotates about an axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-axis, then the volume is determined by
      <me>V = \int_{\textrm{start}}^{\textrm{finish}} 2\pi (\textrm{radius from axis to rectangle})(\textrm{height of rectangle}) \; dx</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the <m>y</m>-axis, then the volume is determined by
      <me>V = \int_{\textrm{start}}^{\textrm{finish}} 2\pi (\textrm{radius from axis to rectangle})(\textrm{height of rectangle}) \; dy</me>

          Consider the region in the first quadrant bounded by <m>y=x^2</m>, <m>y=0</m>, and <m>x=2</m>.
          Use cylindrical shells to determine the volume of the object obtained by rotating that region about the following axes:

          Use cylindrical shells to show the volume of a cone with height <m>h</m> and radius <m>r</m> is <m>\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h</m>.
          Rotate a triangular region about an axis to obtain a cone with vertex at the origin in the <m>xy</m>-plane.

          Use cylindrical shells to show the volume of a sphere with radius <m>r</m> is <m>\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3</m>.
          Rotate a semi-circular region centered at the origin to obtain the sphere.
