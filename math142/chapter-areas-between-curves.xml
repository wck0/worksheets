  <title>Areas Between Curves</title>
  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      The area of a region in the plane bounded above by <m>f(x)</m> and below by <m>g(x)</m> for <m>x</m> values between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is given by
      <me>\int_a^b f(x) - g(x) \; dx</me>
      It's usually helpful to look at a graph to get a better sense of the situation.

        <p>
          Determine the area of the regions enclosed by the curves listed below.
          Draw a picture for each one.

      <task>
        <m>y=x^2</m>, <m>y=8-x^2</m>
      </task>
      <task>
        <m>y=x^2</m>, <m>y=8-x^2</m>, in the first quadrant. (Hint: use symmetry.)
      </task>
      <task>
        <m>y=\sqrt{x}</m>, <m>y=2\sqrt{x}</m>, <m>x=4</m>, <m>x=9</m>

      <task>
        <m>y=\sqrt{x}</m>, <m>y=2\sqrt{x}</m>, <m>x=9</m>
      </task>
      <task>
        <m>y=\sqrt{x}</m>, <m>y=2\sqrt{x}</m>, <m>x=4</m> (Hint: use the last two.)
      </task>
      <task>
        <m>y=\cos(\pi x / 2)</m>, <m>y= 1-x^2</m>, in the first quadrant. Explain how, without graphing, you could determine which of the two curves is "on top."

      <task>
        <m>y=\ln(x)</m>, <m>y=0</m>, <m>x=e</m>, but with your head sideways (unless that's what you did the first time, in which case do it with your head upright).
